<h1 align="center">
The journey behind my proposal
</h1>

Today I just finished my last exam for this semester. It was on Convex Optimization, my favorite class of my undergraduate experience (so far!).

I decided it was a good time to share with you a brief story about my growing interests in Optimization and CVXPY which culminated into an accepted proposal for Google Summer of Code.

<h2 id="convex">Convex Optimization</h2>

The Convex Optimization class at University of Manchester was taught by Professor [Matthew Thorpe](https://www.matthewthorpe.co.uk/home). I chose this class because the Math Minor at Concordia required a similar class on Optimization. 

Little did I know, I was in for quite a ride.

The teacher provided preliminary material to help us prepare for the course. Upon reading it over, I instantly thought about dropping the class, there was atleast half of that content I had little to no familiarity with.

But I stuck with it... I read the notes over and over, then I discovered Stephen Boyd's [amazing lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLq1hEq3UY&list=PL3940DD956CDF0622) online which inspired me to keep learning.

I went to the live lectures, didn't understand a single thing, then watched the pre-recorded lectures, also didn't understand much, then I went to the revision session and we were given weekly problem sheets, I couldn't do them by myself, I ended up memorizing the solutions and regurgitating them later.

But during this process, I looked at the non-examinable portion of the course and found something I really enjoyed: practical implementations of optimization problems in Python, using a modeling language called CVXPY.

<h2 id="cvxpy">Joining CVXPY</h2>

Upon taking a glance at the documentation, I found a link to CVXPY's [discord](https://discord.com/invite/4urRQeGBCr) community. 

Out of curiosity, I decided to join and see what was happening. For the first few weeks, I was constantly [lurking](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/lurking) the general chat and learning about different issues people would encounter when using CVXPY.

From there, I started reading the pull requests from the CVXPY [github repository](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy) and I had a growing desire to make some of my own contributions.

I started by looking into the list of [issues](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/issues) and thought I could perhaps resolve one of them. There was one about adding support for complex differentiation that caught my eye. 

However, with little to no knowledge on complex analysis, and only a few weeks of experience using CVXPY, I wasn't making much progress at all. 

Around that time, I found out about Google Summer of Code ([GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com)) through CVXPY's [two projects](https://github.com/cvxpy/GSOC2022) that were completed last year.

<h2 id="mimuc presentation">Presentation at MIMUC</h2>

In the middle of the semester, there was a an opportunity for undergraduate students to present an interesting topic of their choice related to mathematics. I decided I had to take on the challenge and signed up.

I proposed an abstract titled: "Convex Programming with CVXPY", I wanted to give an introduction to the Convex Optimization course but with an emphasis on the programming aspect of modern tools.

You can find the slides for my presentation [here](/documents/Convex_Programming_with_CVXPY_(slides).pdf).
