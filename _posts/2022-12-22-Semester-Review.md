  Here is a copy of the grid from the puzzle:

My first assumption was that the die was numbered from 1 to 6.

However, after the first move, landing on '5', we are already unable to move anymore.
</p>

<p>
Then I considered allowing decreases in values to reach the '-7' square. 
 
However, after a few other moves, we also get stuck. 
</p>

<p>
Then I quickly realised the complexity of this puzzle.

In addition to discovering a path that could lead to the blue square, the main idea was that all six die values are unknown.

And we must find them.
