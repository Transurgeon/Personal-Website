# MoreGlean

This past weekend I attended the Morgan Stanley's Code to Give Hackathon in Montreal. 

The main idea was to build a web application that could connect farmers, gleaners and food banks. 

Gleaners refers to a group of people who are willing to collect additional crops from the farmers to avoid food waste.

The winning team would receive **500 USD** for each member, and some potential internships at Morgan Stanley. 

In addition, Earth Day Canada, a non-profit owned by Morgan Stanley, will also probably be implementing your web app or atleast parts of it. 

It is for a good cause after all, why not give it your best shot?

Here is a link to our submission: [MoreGlean](https://github.com/diegodofe/MoreGlean)

Yes, we did try to integrate the word "glean" into Morgan Stanley... 

It didn't turn out to be as funny as we initially expected.
