<h1 align="center">
The journey behind my proposal
</h1>

Today I just finished my last exam for this semester. It was on Convex Optimization, my favorite class of my undergraduate experience (so far!).

I decided it was a good time to share with you a brief story about my growing interests in Optimization and CVXPY which culminated into an accepted proposal for Google Summer of Code.

<h2 id="convex">Convex Optimization</h2>

The Convex Optimization class at University of Manchester was taught by Professor [Matthew Thorpe](https://www.matthewthorpe.co.uk/home). I chose this class because the Math Minor at Concordia required a similar class on Optimization. 

Little did I know, I was in for quite a ride.

The teacher provided preliminary material to help us prepare for the course. Upon reading it over, I instantly thought about dropping the class, there was atleast half of that content I had little to no familiarity with.

But I stuck with it... I read the notes over and over, then I discovered Stephen Boyd's [amazing lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McLq1hEq3UY&list=PL3940DD956CDF0622) online which inspired me to keep learning.

I went to the live lectures, didn't understand a single thing, then watched the pre-recorded lectures, also didn't understand much, then I went to the revision session and we were given weekly problem sheets, I couldn't do them by myself, I ended up memorizing the solutions and regurgitating them later.

But during this process, I looked at the non-examinable portion of the course and found something I really enjoyed: practical implementations of optimization problems in Python, using a modeling language called CVXPY.

<h2 id="cvxpy">Joining CVXPY</h2>

Upon taking a glance at the documentation, I found a link to CVXPY's [discord](https://discord.com/invite/4urRQeGBCr) community. 

Out of curiosity, I decided to join and see what was happening. For the first few weeks, I was constantly [lurking](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/lurking) the general chat and learning about different issues people would encounter when using CVXPY.

From there, I started reading the pull requests from the CVXPY [github repository](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy) and I had a growing desire to make some of my own contributions.

I started by looking into the list of [issues](https://github.com/cvxpy/cvxpy/issues) and thought I could perhaps resolve one of them. There was one about adding support for complex differentiation that caught my eye. 

However, with little to no knowledge on complex analysis, and only a few weeks of experience using CVXPY, I wasn't making much progress at all. 

Around that time, I found out about Google Summer of Code ([GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com)) through CVXPY's [two projects](https://github.com/cvxpy/GSOC2022) that were completed last year.

<h2 id="mimuc presentation">Presentation at MIMUC</h2>

In the middle of the semester, there was an opportunity for undergraduate students to present an interesting topic of their choice related to mathematics. I decided I had to take on the challenge and signed up.

My abstract was titled: "Convex Programming with CVXPY"; I wanted to give an introduction to the Convex Optimization course but with an emphasis on the programming aspects of modern tools.

<h2 id="reach">Reaching out</h2>

Around the same time, my CO-OP supervisor at Concordia was pressing me to find a job for this summer. However, I really wanted to do something related to Open Source and decided to stray away from the normal path.

But apparently having completed three CO-OP terms is supposed to be impressive, so I still thought about ways I could remain in the program.

Desperate for solutions, I reached out to a CVXPY open source maintainer asking for any potential opportunities.

There was first a position to revamp the [documentation](https://www.cvxpy.org/), which had already been taken. But then I was proposed to do a project for this year's GSoC. 

I was like, of course I want to do that! 

<h2 id="deadline">GSoC Application Deadline</h2>

The only problem was that I had to write a lengthy proposal detailing the project, benefits to the community, and weekly tasks to be completed.

I have a story to tell about this proposal. 

I was visiting Brussels with my flatmate Gaurav, when I receive a message saying that the deadline to submit the proposal was in two days. 

Not wanting to ruin the trip, I carry on visiting the city during the day and decided I would work at night. The problem is, we came back to the hostel around 1am and I was also exhausted from the abundance of kilometers we covered. 

Despite the circumstances, I got to work. 

After giving up many times as sleep deprivation was creeping in, I completed two of the main sections of the proposal. It was 5:30am... and we had to check out by 11am. 

The next day, I find some time to polish the entire proposal but I am still missing one final part to complete it. It was due at 8pm, but we had to travel to Antwerp before 9pm. So I turn on my hotspot on the bus, open my Ipad and start writing. 

Up until 7:50pm, I was entirely focused and managed to finish everything. After compiling the PDF and proof-reading, I submit my proposal at 7:56pm, four little minutes before the deadline.

Looking back, it seems like the struggle turned out to be worth it after all.
