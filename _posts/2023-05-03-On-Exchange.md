Life as an exchange student

<h2 id="settling-in">Settling in</h2>

My journey in the UK started with a two week vacation with my dad before the beginning of classes. 

We visited London, Edinburgh and Glasgow before heading to Manchester.

In MCR we were welcomed by Edward (the son of an acquaintance of my mom's). He cooked amazing chinese cuisine for us and we had an awesome first few days in Manchester.

It was then time to move into my student accomodation in Whitworth Park (see picture below) to prepare for the beginning of the semester.

<h2 id="events">Societies and events</h2>

In Manchester, I had the opportunity to participate in a lot of social events and activities. 

Notably, I joined the MMA society who had sessions every weekend. I learned a lot of striking techniques and even got to be team captain for a grappling team deathmatch. 

I also participated in the Imperial--Cambridge Mathematics Competition ([ICMC](https://icmathscomp.org)) along with a few teammates from Warwick and Manchester University. We literally finished last place... but the problems were quite fun and the experience was awesome.

There is also a concert venue in Manchester, the Bridgewater Hall. I had the absolute honor to get front row tickets to see [Eric Lu](https://www.ericlupianist.com/#/home) play [Schubert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SD6lZn_7C_s). (Not to mention, the tickets were discounted for students.. only 5.5£)

Finally, I got to play the piano a few times myself. I sneaked in into the [RNCM](https://www.rncm.ac.uk) practice rooms and played on an amazing [Steinway D class](https://www.steinway.com/pianos/steinway/grand/model-d) concert grand piano. I definitely need to get back into the habit of practicing music this summer. 

<h2 id="AliG">Alan Gilbert Learning Commons</h2>

Surprisingly enough, the learning commons (aka "[Ali G](https://studentnews.manchester.ac.uk/2019/04/08/the-big-issue-main-library-or-ali-g-my-thoughts-after-three-years-here/)") was the place where I spent most of my time and developed my best friendships.

At the beginning, for the sake of a change in atmosphere, I would switch between the main library and the Learning Commons every few days. But slowly and surely, I met some studious people from all kinds of backgrounds and decided to stick to the modern 24/7 Learning Commons as my permanent residence (I mean literally! for a whole month, I only went back to my dorm to get some sleep). 



<h2 id="ramadan">Ramadan</h2>

This year I also decided to participate in [Ramadan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting_during_Ramadan#:~:text=During%20the%20entire%20month%20of,food%2C%20drinking%2C%20and%20smoking) with my Turkish friend Gürsel. 

We decided to adapt our sleep schedule to help alleviate some difficulties from the fasting. We would stay up until 4am to do some studying, then wake up around 1pm which meant that we only had a few hours left before we were allowed to break the fast. 

Some days were very challenging, especially when we had to focus on getting work done with an empty stomach. But I think with the amount of planning we did, it wasn't too bad afterall. I think fasting has a lot of benefits for the human body, and I personally noticed that I have a deeper appreciation for food and water.

I even went to the Mosque twice to pray with my friends. It was quite an eye-opening experience; from the sheer dedication of some muslims to the "brotherhood" aspect of the religion, I really felt welcomed amongst the community and inspired to become a better man.

Here you can find some pictures of us preparing for the first [Iftar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iftar#:~:text=Iftar%20is%20one%20of%20the,prayer%2C%20which%20is%20around%20sunset) of the holy month.

<h2 id="EuropeTravel">Travelling in Europe</h2>

During Easter break, I went to Europe with Gaurav, my flatmate in Whitworth. 

Gaurav is a first year law student from Toronto, and he is a big fan of hockey, football and MMA. We bonded over these common interests and he was also my first study partner. 

During our trip we visited multiple cities in Belgium, Amsterdam and Germany. We resided in hostels and fueled on kebabs and salads in order to save up a bit. 

In Brussels we visited the [European Parliament](https://visiting.europarl.europa.eu/en) and the [Grand Place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand-Place) at night.

In Antwerp we visited the local zoo (left picture below) along with the diamond district.

In Amsterdam we visited the famous [red light district](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-light_district) and walked around the [Royal Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Palace_of_Amsterdam) and the many canals longing the city center.

In Cologne we visited a [Gestapo Museum](https://museenkoeln.de/ns-dokumentationszentrum/default.aspx?s=315) and walked around the many bridges near the [Cathedral](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cologne_Cathedral).

Finally, in Berlin we watched Herta Belin versus Leipzig in the [Nazi Olympic Stadium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936_Summer_Olympics) (right picture below). We also travelled north to the [Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sachsenhausen_concentration_camp) and saw first hand the living conditions of war prisoners.

Overall, we had an awesome week of memorable moments and educational nourishment from historical places and their stories...

but at the same time, I had spent way too much money and it was time to go back to Manchester.
