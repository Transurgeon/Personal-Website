Life as an exchange student

<h2>Settling in</h2>

My journey in the UK started with a two week vacation with my dad before the beginning of classes. 

We visited London, Edinburgh and Glasgow before heading to Manchester.

In MCR we were welcomed by Edward (the son of an acquaintance of my mom's). He cooked amazing chinese cuisine for us and we had an awesome first few days in Manchester.

It was then time to move into my student accomodation in Whitworth Park (see picture below) to prepare for the beginning of the semester.
