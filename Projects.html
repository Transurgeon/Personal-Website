                        <dt>Implemented a Raspberry Pi for learning about networking protocols. The setup uses ethernet and remote connection via Secure Shell (SSH) on a local private network. The Raspberry Pi also uses Pi-hole to block Internet tracking and advertisements.
                    </dt><dd>•	Implemented UNIX commands to navigate the Pi through SSH. Notable commands: grep, man, find</dd>
                        <dd>• Automated tasks using bash scripting, ex: Updating the Pi’s Live Web Server every week. The Web server allows all the files of the Pi to be remotely downloadable.</dd>
                        <dd>•	Learned about the DHCP protocol and how to configure the Pi as a DHCP server.</dd>  </dl>
