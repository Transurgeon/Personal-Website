                        <dt>https://github.com/Transurgeon/ProjectEuler.Net Solving Math related problems using Computer Science concepts and code.  
                    </dt><dd>•	Using Visual Studio and the C# language, a partner and I have solved around 70 problems on Project Euler, a series of challenging math and programming problems. This journey allowed us to discover unfamiliar areas of math and learn new concepts. </dd>
                        <dd>•	All the source code and explanation have been included in the GitHub repository. A YouTube channel that will explain some of the hardest and interesting/fun problems is a future goal of mine.</dd>

                <li>Raspberry Pi Setup and Networking (Personal) 2021-present
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Implemented a Raspberry Pi for learning about networking protocols. The setup uses ethernet and remote connection via Secure Shell (SSH) on a local private network. The Raspberry Pi also uses Pi-hole to block Internet tracking and advertisements.
                    </dt><dd>•	Implemented UNIX commands to navigate the Pi through SSH. Notable commands: grep, man, find</dd>
                        <dd>• Automated tasks using bash scripting, ex: Updating the Pi’s Live Web Server every week. The Web server allows all the files of the Pi to be remotely downloadable.</dd>
                        <dd>•	Learned about the DHCP protocol and how to configure the Pi as a DHCP server.</dd>
