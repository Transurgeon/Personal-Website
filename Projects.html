                    Pen-testing and Security Self-learning (Personal)	2021-present
                    Independent learning about security topics and experience with Penetration testing on virtual machines 
                    •	Using online resources like TryHackMe and OverTheWire to implement tools and commands on intentionally vulnerable machines.
                    •	Scanning Network and open ports using Nmap and Netcat. Researching about specific vulnerabilities on NVD,
                    •	Important chapters completed: Linux Fundamentals, Bash Scripting, Intro to Pen-testing
                    Core Competencies: Independent Learning, Adaptability, Research and Investigation

                    Project Euler: Progress - Project Euler  (Personal)	2021-present
                    https://github.com/Transurgeon/ProjectEuler.Net Solving Math related problems using Computer Science concepts and code.  
                    •	Using Visual Studio and the C# language, a partner and I have solved around 70 problems on Project Euler, a series of challenging math and programming problems. This journey allowed us to discover unfamiliar areas of math and learn new concepts. 
                    •	All the source code and explanation have been included in the GitHub repository. A YouTube channel that will explain some of the hardest and interesting/fun problems is a future goal of mine.
                    Core Competencies: Teamwork, Problem assessment, Mathematical Implementation/Discovery/Intuition

                    Raspberry Pi Setup and Networking (Personal)	2021-present
                    Implemented a Raspberry Pi for learning about networking protocols. The setup uses ethernet and remote connection via Secure Shell (SSH) on a local private network. The Raspberry Pi also uses Pi-hole to block Internet tracking and advertisements.
                    •	Implemented UNIX commands to navigate the Pi through SSH. Notable commands: grep, man, find
                    •	Automated tasks using bash scripting, ex: Updating the Pi’s Live Web Server every week. The Web server allows all the files of the Pi to be remotely downloadable.
                    •	Learned about the DHCP protocol and how to configure the Pi as a DHCP server.  
                    Core Competencies: Problem assessment, Self-Teaching, Troubleshooting
